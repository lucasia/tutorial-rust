// vector - allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.

// string - collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the String type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.

// hash map - allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map.
